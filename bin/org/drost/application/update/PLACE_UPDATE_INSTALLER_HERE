Place the update_installer.jar in the resource folder.

In UpdateManager: 
1. create a static field that initial stores the current jar file path. 
2. When updating, check whether the initial path still contains the current jar file. (This may not be the case if it has been removed).
3. If it is not contained in the initial folder, get the new jar file path.
4. Run the update_installer.jar on the correct path of the current application (jar file).
	- Therefore create a copy of the update_installer.jar in the applications execution path.
